## GSoC '22 Phase 1.1

### How did I get here? And what is Google Summer of Code (GSoC) anyway?

Honestly, twitter. Sometime in February 2022 I had become interested in the open source geospatial stack. I found [this](https://spatial-analytics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/introduction.html) spatial analytics with python course by Henrikki Tenkanen and started working through the lessons. This introduced me to geopandas; I was quckly impressed with the package and started following Martin Fleischmann on [twitter](https://twitter.com/martinfleis). Luckily for me he posted about the PySAL GSoC projects and I found one that seemed to be an excellent fit! Despite being a serial internet-lurker and having strong feelings of inadequacy I decided to engage with the community (the horror!) and express my intrest in the spatial optimization library enhancements.

### Bonding Period
Introduce myself in the PySAL gitter. Join my first PySAL GSoC student/dev meeting.

### Environment Setup
I use Anaconda to setup my python environment. I use VS Code to edit the `spopt` package. I like Jupyter notebooks for deving my code.
Holy shit `pip install -e` both life changing and frustrating! Don't forget __init__.py file!!!
