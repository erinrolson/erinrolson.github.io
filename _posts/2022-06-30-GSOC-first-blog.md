## GSoC '22 Phase 1.1

I have just completed Phase 1.1 of my Google Summer of Code project commitment!

### How did I get here? And what is Google summer of Code anyway?

Honestly, twitter. Martin. Pleasantly suprised to be accepted.

### Bonding Period
Introduce myself in the PySAL gitter. Join my first PySAL GSoC student/dev meeting.

### Environment Setup
I use Anaconda to setup my python environment. I use VS Code to edit the `spopt` package. I like Jupyter notebooks for deving my code.
Holy shit `pip install -e` both life changing and frustrating! Don't forget __init__.py file!!!
