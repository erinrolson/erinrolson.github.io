## GSoC '22 Phase 1.2

### Phase 1.2 - Implement P-Dispersion
Now that I had successfully implemented my first class I had a much better understanding of all the steps I needed to take for a proper implementation. I decided early on that I would try to implement the model, but if I got stuck and the fomulation wasn't quite right, I would move on to other tasks that could be done regardless of whether or not the model was built yet (until I could get assistance). I also decided to ask for help sooner rather than later. I make it a point to put a great deal of effort into solving issues on my own. I don't want to bother others unnecessarily, but sometimes this causes me to lose a day or more on real progress when reaching out for help can resolve the issue in 15 minutes. With the LSCPB implementation behind me and a new strategy for seeking assistance from my mentors, I had a lot of success in implementing the P-Dispersion problem. 

#### Coding - Week 8
I spent the beginning of the week reading about the P-Dispersion problem and familiarizing myself with a few possible formulations. I was able to get a basic dev notebook together before our Wednesday morning meeting which was attended by Levi and James. Our meeting was really productive, Levi and James walked me through solving the problem step-by-step and we discussed strategies for checking the model was solving as expected. After the meeting I did a focused sprint to try and build the model properly, I was able to get a decent formulation together, but I knew I wasn't quite right. I didn't want to waste any time so I reached out to my mentors for feedback and James was able to get me on track quickly.
