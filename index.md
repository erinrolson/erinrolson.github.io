I've opted to take a break from traditional work activites to explore 
spatial data analytics and expand my software development knowledge.

I'm broadly interested in GIScience, sustainability issues, and 
open-source geospatial projects.

I'm proud to be accepted as a Google Summer of Code 2022 Contributer for the PySAL Spatial Optimization library! 
My role for the summer will be to implement new spatial optimization models for the package,
as well as enrich existing optimization models with additional parameters. 

  
 
 
Here you can say lots of fun things about your site.

Maybe say a some things about yourself.

Or maybe what you plan to blog about.
