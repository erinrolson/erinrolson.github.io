I'm broadly interested in GIScience, sustainability issues, and open-source geospatial projects. I've recently opted to take a break from traditional work activites to explore spatial data analytics and expand my software development knowledge.

Currently, I'm proud to be accepted as a Google Summer of Code 2022 Contributer for the PySAL Spatial Optimization library! My role for the summer is to implement new spatial optimization models for the package, as well as enrich existing optimization models with additional parameters.
