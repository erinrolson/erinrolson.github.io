I'm broadly interested in GIScience, sustainability issues, and open-source geospatial projects. I've recently opted to take a break from traditional work activites to explore spatial data analytics and expand my software development knowledge.

Currently, I'm proud to be accepted as a <a href=https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about>Google Summer of Code 2022 Contributer</a> for the <a href=https://pysal.org/spopt/#>PySAL Spatial Optimization library</a>! My role for the summer is to implement new spatial optimization models for the package, as well as enrich existing optimization models with additional parameters.
